### PROJECT SUMMARY
Created an advanced Excel dashboard to analyze and visualize sales data, customer behavior, and operational metrics for a multi-location coffee shop business in New York City.

### PROJECT OBJECTIVE
To develop a comprehensive Excel-based analytics dashboard that provides actionable insights for optimizing operations, enhancing customer experience, and increasing profitability across multiple New York City coffee shop locations.


### DASHBOARD LAYOUT
The dashboard is designed as a single-page view in Excel, providing a comprehensive yet concise overview of the coffee shop's performance. 
It uses a combination of charts, tables, and KPI indicators to present data in an easily digestible format.

Slicers are used for additional filtering options (e.g., by product category)
